![The West Wing](http://img2-1.timeinc.net/ew/i/2013/03/25/West-Wing-Sheen.jpg)

In my home office I have two writing shelves. One that proudly displays [books I have written](/special-bookshelf), and one that holds books that inspire me or guide me.

In pride of place on the inspiration shelf is a book of scripts from The West Wing, the US TV drama series about work and life behind the scenes in the White House. Reading these scripts is a great demonstration of the power of good writing. It's so crisp and concise, but contains all of the energy and meaning that you see on the screen. Just reading a script brings everything alive in your head. You can see what I mean by reading a PDF of [the script for the pilot episode](http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/West_Wing_Pilot.pdf).

Recently, Empire magazine published [The Definitive History Of The West Wing](http://www.empireonline.com/westwing/), compiled from interviews with the key cast members, the director, and the writer Aaron Sorkin himself. It's quite similar to a previous article by the [Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/west-wing-uncensored-aaron-sorkin-703010).

They're a fascinating insight into how a great TV programme is made. These are the points I drew from the articles.

## The Writer Has The Confidence To Lead
Aaron Sorkin has a reputation as a bit of a primadonna, but at least he asserts himself where so many writers are in the background. He's the man with the vision for the series, and every great project needs a visionary to drive it through. However, maybe there is an ideal middle ground somewhere!

The cast talk about him insisting they perform his lines as written, because of the precision of meaning and cadence that goes into the writing. But they seem to be able to discuss ideas with him to feed into that writing.

They're also impressed that what he puts in the script ends up on set in terms of the scale. In one quote a cast member says "If Aaron has written that the presidential motorcade has 75 cars, it'll have 75, not 74."

## Great TV writing snaps and crackles

## Great TV relies on a magic combination of script, cast and director

## The People That Run Studios and TV Networks Have No Idea What Makes Great TV

## Constraints are good
