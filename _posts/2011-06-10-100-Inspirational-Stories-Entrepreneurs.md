Last year I had the privilege of being one of the writers behind a series of booklets published by HSBC Bank called '100 Thoughts'.

We scoured the world looking for interesting business people with good ideas and great execution, and wrote their stories up into bite-size nuggets of inspiration. It's not just the idea for their products we focused on - but how they actually do business.

The booklets are now all available to download, and you can browse some of the ideas online too, at http://www.100thoughts.hsbc.co.uk/ . You can also pick up the booklets in HSBC branches.
