After a busy few months (years), I've escaped to the South West of England for a few days of holiday.

Step by step I'm doing the South West Coastal path over many long weekends. In total there are 638 miles of it. I've done about 80. I'll blog about the past adventures another time, but this is about this morning.

This holiday is mainly about something else (more of which tomorrow), but I managed to fit in a short stroll of a few miles along the north Devon coast from the Heddon Valley to Woody Bay and back.

I drove down from London last night, and arrived at the Inn through winding narrow country lanes, already feeling a million miles away from the city.

This morning I woke up early and set off after a hearty breakfast.

At the start of the walk, I got my first proper view of the Inn in daylight.



It's the only building for some distance, and feels nicely remote.

The walk began along a small river flowing down through the Heddon Valley.



I then slowly climbed to the coastal path.



With the beautiful autumn colours of the ferns.



It was a drizzly day, creating a slightly muddy path, and you really wouldn't want to slip...



At one point the path crossed the path of this rather beautiful waterfall...



Before arriving at Woody Bay...



And then turning round and heading back to the Inn for a well earned pint (or two).
