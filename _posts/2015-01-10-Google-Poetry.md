Recently I started typing a search query into Google and noticed that the auto-suggest options could be interesting by themselves. Some as insights into what people search for â€” but others because they read almost like mini poems.

So I played around a little, and here is what the Google Poet came up with...

Some really rhyme...

Some are deep...

Some are wistful...

The Google Poet has had its heart broken too...

And late at night, it seems the Google poet gets a little frisky...
