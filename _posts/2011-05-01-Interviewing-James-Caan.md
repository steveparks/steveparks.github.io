A few months ago I chaired a web TV programme for Natwest that featured James Caan on the panel.

He's best known for his time on the Dragon's Den programme, and fans of the show wil have noticed with interest the amount of beard stroking going on when the entrepreneur on the panel was describing her business and the fact she was looking for investment.

Amanda Faulkener-Whalen runs a business printing 3D plastic items, and plans to make customised toys with it. She has a very sharp business mind, and James was clearly impressed. I wouldn't be surprised if they end up doing some business.
