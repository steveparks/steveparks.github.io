Last weekend I popped down to Ben Spalding's new place at John Salt in Islington for his take on Sunday Roast. It was a great combination between family Sunday Roast - no choice, plate piled high, enormous amounts of gravy (he serves a great big jug of it on the table) and a professional chef roast, with creativity and good cooking. Here's the main:



Note the flattened, scraped, crispy chicken skin in the middle, the fact there are two chunky bits of chicken (with the meat very moist and tasty), and lots of different veg. Here's the pudding:


But best of all, for what you get it's fantastic value - Â£19 for two courses. Highly recommended.
