I enjoy watching (some) cookery shows to get inspiration, but later I don't remember what ideas I wanted to try out. So, as I watch them now, I'm going to liveblog some notes.

First up is Episode 1 of Tom Kerridge's Proper Pub Food, in which he focuses on outdoor meals.

## Fried Chicken
Place the chicken pieces in buttermilk overnight in the fridge. The next day coat them in a spice mix that's made from:

* dried marjoram
* dried oregano
* dried basil
* dried sage
* chilli powder
* ground white pepper
* onion salt
* garlic powder
* sweet paprika
* smoked paprika
* salt
* cornflour
* plain flour

Tap off any extra spice mix and then shallow fry, slowly and gently for about 10 minutes per side to get a nice golden colour. Just do a few pieces at once so they fry properly.

Finally put them in the oven for about 10 mins to cook through.


## Fish burgers
Chop up mackerel, pollack, prawns and any other suitable fish/seafood. Add chopped fresh dill, english mustard powder, bicarbonate of soda, capers and garlic to the mix. Shape them into burgers and chill in the fridge for about 20 mins, then barbecue.


## Barbecue Beef Ribs
Use beef shortribs (also known as "Jacob's ladder"). Rub them with a dry cure that is made from:

* sea salt
* cracked black pepper
* smoked paprika
* garlic powder
* ground ginger
* celery salt
* herbs de provence
* chilli powder
* crushed coriander seeds

Put the beef in a plastic tub in the fridge overnight. The next day wash off this dry cure mix.

Soak pickled onions and dates in stout that has just been brought to the boil. Leave to stand for a bit and then blend.

Mix in soft dark sugar, worcester sauce, english mustard, runny honey, black treacle, golden syrup, tomato puree, apple juice, tabasco sauce.

Put the beef in a casserole dish, coat with the glaze mix, and put in oven at 120 degrees for 5-6 hours. Afterwards, leave to cool to room temp, then chill in fridge overnight.

When ready to cook on the barbecue, put the beef on a barbecue-proof tray and pour the sauce over. Cook in the tray on a barbecue with the lid down, basting regularly with the glaze.

## Tomato Salad
Roughly chop a variety of Tomatoes, and finely chop onions, tear off lemon thyme leaves and add, along with some sea salt.

Make croutons by tearing up some good bread, drizzling with warmed beef dripping, and then put in oven until golden.

Finely chop chives and spring onions.

Now, drain the tomatoes and onions of the liquid the salt has helped extract, and stick in the oven for a minute or two to warm up.

You can also add some roast sweet red onions

Make dressing with red wine vinegar or balsamic, onion seeds, chives - and more of the warm beef dripping (or just normal oil).

Mix together, and serve.
